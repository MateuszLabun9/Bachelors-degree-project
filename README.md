This script is part of three-factor authentication system based on the use of Raspberry Pi microcomputer. Designed system allows to secure access to goods using three 
different forms of authorization. The keys used to secure the system are an RFID token, a numeric password and a randomly generated code sent in SMS message. 
Each authorized user has its own set of authentication keys that are validated when attempting to access the system. 
In case of entering wrong keys, system does not grant authorization, additionally, each authentication attempt is recorded for later control.
